# Text Mining
This project aims to construct a comprehensive machine learning and deep learning framework for text mining, 
including text classification, text matching, text generation, information extraction, and so on.

## Run
To run deep leanring models:
`python3 main.py --phase aapr.dl.mlp.norm > aapr.dl.mlp.norm.log`

To run machine learning models:
`python3 main.py --phase aapr.ml.lr.tf > aapr.ml.lr.tf.log`

## To be continued...
