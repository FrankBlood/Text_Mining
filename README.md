# Text Mining
This project aims to construct a comprehensive framework for text mining, including text classification, text matching, text generation, via machine learning and deep learning.

## Run
To run deep leanring models:
`python3 main.py --phase aapr.dl.mlp.norm > aapr.dl.mlp.norm.log`

To run machine learning models:
`python3 main.py --phase aapr.ml.lr.tf > aapr.ml.lr.tf.log`

## To be continued...
